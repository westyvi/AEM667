# AEM667

This is a repository to contain all my projects for AEM667, navigation and target tracking,
at the University of Alabama.

Project 1: Implement a linear kalman filter to estimate the error between two simulated clocks.  

Project 2: Process raw GPS base and rover receiver data into position estimates using double differenced psuedorange multilateration.

Project 3: Implement an error-state EKF to perform loose (position-level) GNSS/INS integration

Project 4: Implement a probability density association filter (PDAF) to track a single target in the presence of clutter and missed detections

Project 5: Implement an RFS-based gaussian-mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter to track multiple targets with clutter and missed detections
