# AEM667

This is a repository to contain all my projects for AEM667, navigation and target tracking,
at the University of Alabama.

Project 1: Implement a linear kalman filter to estimate the error between two simulated clocks.

Project 2: Process raw GPS base and rover receiver data into position estimates using double differenced psuedorange multilateration.
