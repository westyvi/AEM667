The PDAF and EKF, both implemented using ellipsoidal gating on the measurements, perform remarkably similarly. This makes sense, as the only difference between the two is the data association method: nearest neighbor vs all neighbor probabilistic. The PDAF method also weights the nearest neighbor measurement the largest, and hence the output is very similar to an EKF with nearest neighbor. 

The only noticable differences occur when there are multiple measurements very close to the predicted target state. In these cases, the PDAF includes all of these measurements in its update, while the NN EKF chooses one to solely use. A small difference in performance can be seen in multiple locations on the plots where this happens, but the two solutions re-converge once there is only one measurement within the ellipsoidal gate. 

The conclusion here is that the PDAF and NN-EKF, if both implement ellipsoidal gating to avoid divergence due to missed detections, perform very similarly owing to them having only one conceptual difference in their methods. In this case, the PDAF may be a better choice if the sensor data contains much clutter, as it weights all measurements probabilistically and does not 'over-commit' to one measurement like the NN-EKF. However, the difference as seen in this example is marginal. If the EKF does not implement ellipsoidal gating, however, the filter diverges with missed detections. In this case, the PDAF is clearly a superior choice as it does gate the data and does not diverge.
